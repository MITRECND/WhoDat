pyDat
=====

pyDat is a Python implementation of [Chris Clark's](https://github.com/Xen0ph0n)
WhoDat code. It is designed to be more extensible and has more features than
the PHP implementation.

Running pyDat
=============

pyDat does not provide any data on its own. You must provide your own whois
data in a MongoDB. Beyond the data in a MongoDB you will need
[Django](https://djangoproject.com), [pymongo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/),
and [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) (at least 2.2.1).

Populating Mongo with whoisxmlapi data
======================================


- Download latest trimmed (smallest possible) whoisxmlapi quarterly DB dump.
- Extract the csv files.
- Import them (adjust for your needs):
```
for file in */*.csv; do echo $file && mongoimport --db whois --collection whois --file $file --type csv --headerline --upsert --upsertFields domainName; done
```
- Create indexes on domainName, registrant_name, contactEmail and registrant_telephone.
- Copy pydat/custom_settings_example.py to pydat/custom_settings.py.
- Edit pydat/custom_settings.py to suit your needs.
  - Include your DNSDB key if you have one!
- Configure Apache to use the provided wsgi interface to pydat.

Untested Stuff
=============

Chris has an update.py script which I haven't used yet, so all bets are off,
but it should allow you to get regular updates on specific watched fields via
a cron job. For more information please see the [PHP implementation](../master/whodat).

TODO
====

- Move Chris' update script to a common directory and test it out.
- Find a way to implement historical searches.
